## counter

A simple constraint that allows for updating a counter in state under the
condition that the solver can provide the answer to 6 * 7.

The goal for this app is to be a simple-as-possible demonstration of how to
build, sign, deploy and solve a simple pint intent set.

Run from the root of this repo with `nix run .#test-app-counter`
