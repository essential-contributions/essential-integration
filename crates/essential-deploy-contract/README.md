This is a rust library and cli tool that allows you to easily deploy your contract to the server.
Additionally it provides functionality to sign the contract if it's not already signed.

## Create Account
This command allows you to create a new account in your `essential-wallet` if you don't have one already. \
You can then use this account to sign and deploy your contract.
