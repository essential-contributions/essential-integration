# Introduction
Welcome to the **Getting Started** guide for building applications on `essential`. \
This guide is aimed at ambitious developers that want to try building declarative applications.

> We are currently very early in our development process so things may change rapidly. \
Some things will be broken. If you run into any problems, please feel free to file an issue in the appropriate repository.
This guide is currently a work in progress, and will be expanded further with more complex applications.
