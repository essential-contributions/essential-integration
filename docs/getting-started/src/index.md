# Getting Started

Welcome to the **Getting Started** guide for building applications on `essential`. This guide is designed for ambitious developers looking to build declarative applications.

> **Note:** We are in the early stages of development, so things may change rapidly, and some features may be broken. If you encounter any issues, we encourage you to report them in the appropriate repository. This guide is a work in progress and will continue expanding to cover more complex applications.

### Overview

In this guide, you'll learn how to create your first `essential` application. We’ll start with a simple **counter application** that increments a counter — the `essential` equivalent of a "Hello World" app. While trivial, it introduces key concepts that will help you build more complex applications.

`Essential` is a **declarative system** that allows for expressing powerful applications in an elegant and intuitive way.

### What You'll Learn

- How to create an `essential` application
- The basics of declarative programming
- Key concepts involved in `essential` application development

Let’s dive in and start building!
