# Download binaries
Are CI builds binaries for macOS apple silicon and linux.

You can find the binaries as assets on the [latest release](https://github.com/essential-contributions/essential-integration/releases/latest) page.
> Due to macOS restrictions, the binaries will not run at first and you will need to right click on them and select open. \
After doing this once you will be able to run them in the terminal as normal.

> Warning: It's not a great idea to download binaries from the internet and run them on your machine. \
We recommend you use nix or build from source.

> We make an effort at keeping these binaries up to date but they may not be the latest version. \
To see which version a binary is you can check the `flake.lock` file on the commit tagged in the release.
