# Test

In this section, we will test the functionality of the Rust front-end application by interacting with the counter contract. These tests will verify that the application can:

1. Correctly read the current state of the contract.
2. Submit valid solutions to modify the contractâ€™s state.
3. Confirm that state changes are processed accurately.

Each test will focus on a specific aspect of interacting with the contract, ensuring that the front-end functions as expected and communicates correctly with the contract.
