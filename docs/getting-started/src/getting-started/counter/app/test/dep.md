# Dependencies
In this section, we're importing the necessary modules and types for our counter test. We're bringing in the `counter_app` module, which contains our counter-related functions. We also import utilities from `essential_app_utils` for compiling Pint projects and working with databases. The `essential_node` and `essential_types` modules provide types we'll need for interacting with the node.
```rust
{{#include ../../../../../../code/counter-test.rs:use}}
```
