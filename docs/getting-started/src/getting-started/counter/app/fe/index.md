# Application Functionality

In this section, we will write the core application functionality that will be used in our tests to interact with the contract. 

The purpose of this code is to generate the data required to read the contract's state and submit valid solutions.

The following section will be written in:
```
counter/
└── counter-app/
    └── src/
        └── lib.rs
```
