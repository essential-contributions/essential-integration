# Rust front end
In this section we will build a simple front end application in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) to interact with the counter contract.

As previously mentioned there is no reason you have to use Rust to build a front end application. \
You could use any language you like. \
This chapter is optional but you may find it useful to see how to interact with the contract (even if you don't know Rust).
