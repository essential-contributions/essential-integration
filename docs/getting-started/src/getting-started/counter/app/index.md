# Rust Front End

In this section, we will build a simple front-end application in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) to interact with the counter contract.

While Rust is used for this example, you are not required to use it for your front-end development. You can choose any programming language that suits your needs.

This chapter is optional, but it can be helpful to follow along to understand how to interact with the contract, even if you are not familiar with Rust.
