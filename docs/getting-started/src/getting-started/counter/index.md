# Counter
This chapter will take you through the process of creating a simple counter application. \
The aim is to include every step required to create a working application. \
We use Rust for our front end in this example but you can use any language you like for your own applications. \
There is currently better support for Rust due to most `essential` software being written in Rust however we plan to expand this in the future.
