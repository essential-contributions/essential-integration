# Getting Started
This guide will walk you through the process of creating your first `essential` application. \
We will create a simple counter application that increments a counter. \
This will introduce you to the concepts involved in creating `essential` applications. \
The counter application is our version of a "Hello World" application. \
It is a little trivial but it will give you a good understanding of how to create more complex applications. \
Essential is a declarative system that is capable of expressing powerful applications in elegant ways.
