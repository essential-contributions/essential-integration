# Example Application: Token

In this chapter, we will walk you step-by-step through the process of building a more feauture-rich Token application. This guide is designed to cover every step required to create a fully working application.

### Language Choice

For this example, we will be using **Rust** for the front end. Rust is currently the most supported language for `essential` software, as much of the existing codebase is written in Rust.

However, you are free to use any programming language of your choice for your own applications. While Rust offers the best support at the moment, we are actively working to extend support for other languages in the future.
