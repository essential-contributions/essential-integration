# Define the Storage
Define the storage for the token. \
The storage block is where we define the data that the contract will store. \
Here, we define five types that this contract can store; 2 `mapping` types, 2 `b256` values and an `int`.
Add the following:

```pint
{{#include ../../../../code/token/token.pnt:storage}}
```
