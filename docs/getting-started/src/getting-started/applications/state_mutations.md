## State Mutations and Solvers

You may be wondering: **Where do these state mutations come from?**

- **State mutations** (or "solutions") are discovered by **solvers**.
- Solvers can be third-party entities competing to find optimal solutions, or centralized programs such as servers, front-end apps, or wallets, which provide solutions for specific applications.
- The techniques used by solvers to discover these solutions, and the mechanism for including them in blocks, are outside the scope of this guide. For now, know that incentivized actors in the system discover these solutions **off-chain**.

Later in this guide, weâ€™ll explore a simple solution when we test our application.
