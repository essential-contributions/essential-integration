# Essential Architecture

## Builder 

## Node


## Address


> **Note:** Although we will make an effort to keep the state of the Builder, there may be times where the databases need to be wiped due to changes in the database schema.

> **Note:** If the `pintc` changes how it compiles your application or there is a change to our assembly, your contracts will have a new address. This means that if you deploy an app with the same source as another app that was compiled with a different compiler then the two apps will have different addresses and separate state.
