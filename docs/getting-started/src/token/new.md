# New project

Create a new pint project with the following command:

```bash
{{#include ../../../code/token/pint.sh:new_pint}}
```
Our entire application is going to live in the `token` directory. \
There will be multiple contracts in this project and they will live under the `contracts` subdirectory.
The token pint project will be created in the `token/contracts/token` subdirectory.

Your directory structure should look like this:
```
{{#include ../../../code/token/out1.txt}}
```
